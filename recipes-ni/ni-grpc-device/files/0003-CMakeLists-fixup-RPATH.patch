Subject: [PATCH] CMakeLists: fixup RPATH

When cross-compiling, cmake writes RPATHs using the host machine's
paths. Normally, when cmake executes the `install` target, it rewrites
the paths to conform to the install prefix. Because the current cmake
implementation does not express a real `install` target, the paths are
never fixed.

Set BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_PATH=TRUE for the ni_grpc_device_server target,
so that cross compile binaries always use the supposed install prefix
paths.
