# Restrict virtual memory allocations to a percentage of the RAM that the
# kernel makes available for virtual memory (the "CommitLimit" figure in
# /proc/meminfo).  This setting was determined empirically.

# The maximum "safe" value of vm.overcommit_ratio (i.e., to avoid the OOM
# killer) depends on the working set of the system, particularly for those
# processes which are not mlockall()'d. Values above 98 are known to be unsafe.

# Note: The overcommit ratio is now set by the nisetcommitratio script using
# memory reservation amounts defined in ni-rt.ini
