# rtgroups: kernel task scheduling policy for NI Linux RT (DOC-303197)
#
# Applies specified sched_class, priority, and affinity to kernel
# tasks in accordance with a set of policy files, at "/etc/rtgroups"
# and "/etc/rtgroups.d/*.rtgroups" .
#
# "/etc/rtgroups" is a generic policy maintained by the distribution.
# "/etc/rtgroups.d/*.rtgroups" files override the generic policy for
# specific drivers/modules and/or system use cases.
#
# When invoked, rtctl iterates over every kernel task and attempts to
# match it's name to a single policy rule. "/etc/rtgroups" is read first
# then "/etc/rtgroups.d/*.rtgroups", sourced in alphabetical order. Last
# rule to match a task's name wins. Task are left unchanged if (a) their
# names do not match any rule or (b) they are not kernel tasks.
#
# rtctld invokes rtctl once during boot and each time a new kernel task
# is created.
#
#
# Rule format: <groupname>:<sched_class>:<priority>:<affinity>:<nameregex>
#
# <groupname> is a name/title for documentation purposes and must start
# at beginning of line.
#
# <sched_class> is a single letter, one of the following:
#   'f' (fifo)
#   'b' (batch)
#   'r' (round-robin)
#   'o' (other)
#   '*' (leave task unchanged)
#
# <priority> is an integer 0-99. Unused when <sched_class> is '*'.
#
# <affinity> is a CPU bitmask. Set to '*' to leave task unchanged.
#
# <nameregex> is an awk-style regular expression of kernel task name(s).
#

# Default policy
kthreadd:f:25:*:\[kthreadd\]$
irqthread:f:15:*:\[irq\/.+\]$
ksoftirqd:f:8:*:\[ksoftirqd\/.+\]$
