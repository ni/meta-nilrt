# There are a number of modifiers that are allowed to be used in some
# of the different fields. They provide the following subsitutions:
#
# %n the "kernel number" of the device.
#    For example, 'sda3' has a "kernel number" of '3'
# %e the smallest number for that name which does not matches an existing node
# %k the kernel name for the device
# %M the kernel major number for the device
# %m the kernel minor number for the device
# %b the bus id for the device
# %c the string returned by the PROGRAM
# %s{filename} the content of a sysfs attribute
# %% the '%' char itself
