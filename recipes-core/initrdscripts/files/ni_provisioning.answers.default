#             power-loss safe image updates via RAUC. The default.
#  "efi-auto" = Automatic EFI boot from an ESP containing boot loader
#               at /efi/boot/bootx64.efi path. Useful for booting
#               removable storage and VMs where EFI nvram configuration

# Specify a partition label to use for the nilrt partition.
# This option does not support the "?" value to cause an interactive user prompt.
# You should always use a value of "nilrt" unless you have a specific use case where you know another value will work correctly.
