# Various packages dynamically add users and groups to the system at package
# install time.  For programs that do not care what the uid/gid is of the
# resulting users/groups, the order of the install will determine the final
# uid/gid.  This can lead to non-deterministic uid/gid values from one build
# to another.  Use the following settings to specify that all user/group adds
# should be created based on a static passwd/group file.
#
# Note, if you enable or disable the useradd-staticids in a configured system,
# the TMPDIR may contain incorrect uid/gid values.  Clearing the TMPDIR
# will correct this condition.
#
# By default the system looks in the BBPATH for files/passwd and files/group
# the default can be overriden by specifying USERADD_UID/GID_TABLES.
