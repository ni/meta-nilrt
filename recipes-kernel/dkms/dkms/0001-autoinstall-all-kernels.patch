Subject: [PATCH] dkms: autoinstall for all kernels by default

If you have installed another kernel that would be the next one you
boot into, but you're still on the old kernel, then if you install a
dkms-enabled driver then by default the dkms common posting will only
install for the "current" kernel and the "newest" (which in 3.0.10
only has logic for dpkg and rpm distros-- e.g., not nilrt).

On nilrt, if you do:
- opkg install packagegroup-ni-next-kernel
- opkg install ni-daqmx

then the dkms-enabled packages will run their postinsts, but only build
for the currently-running kernel; this will _not_ be the kernel you
enter on next boot, because we've installed the -next kernel.

dkms does have an option for building for all available kernels; turn
this on for the nilrt distribution, as this better matches the user
expectations for the way that kernels are treated on nilrt.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [nilrt-specific quirk about how we handle kernels]
